# Analyze-NYSE-Data
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&amp;P 500 companies. Udacity have created a smaller subset of the data that i will be using for the project.
